git rm
git rm --cached 
git diff
git diff --staged 
git commit -a -m "<message here>" # works after one commit
git log -p -number (optional to display req commits)
env variable git added 
git status
git status -s (small status)
git restore --staged <file name here>
touch <file> to create a file in root dictionary 
clear   clears terminal 
.gitignore file (put file names you dont want to push or pull put a / before file to check that file in only\n
                         only your root dictionary otherwise checks all places to ignore for filenames in gitignore)
highlight the bar and write cmd there to open cmd in the given directory 
git branch (shows all branches)
git branch <name here> to make new branch adn stays in the current branch
git checkout -b <name here> to make new branch and switch to it
{branches are used to make edits in a code without changing or altering the main file}
{example branch master and B I switch to B and then change bubble sort in B and commit in B}
{then changes will be made only in b and with using git checkout master i can go back to master}
{and in master branch changes wont show unless i commit them there.till then they will only be in B}
{if i use git checkout B then changes will again show in the file under B branch}
git merge <new-branch> to merge branches
git branch -d <branch name> to delete branch after merging its safe to do so
