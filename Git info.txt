git branch (shows all branches)
git branch <name here> to make new branch adn stays in the current branch
git checkout -b <name here> to make new branch and switch to it
{branches are used to make edits in a code without changing or altering the main file}
{example branch master and B I switch to B and then change bubble sort in B and commit in B}
{then changes will be made only in b and with using git checkout master i can go back to master}
{and in master branch changes wont show unless i commit them there.till then they will only be in B}
{if i use git checkout B then changes will again show in the file under B branch}
git merge <new-branch> to merge branches
git branch -d <branch name> to delete branch after merging its safe to do so
